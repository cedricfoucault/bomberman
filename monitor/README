=== Introduction ===

This file briefly documents the monitoring program.  This program is able to
introduce some delay and jitter in UDP streams and TCP connections.  Just for
the sake of being clear, the _delay_ of a package is the time
it takes to travel from source to destination. The _jitter_ of a stream of
packages is a mesure of the deviation that packages of the stream suffer.

The monitor is meant to be placed `in front' of the server, i.e.  it will act
as a new server that receives your TCP connections or UDP streams and forward
them to the actual server, introducing a variable delay on the packages.


=== Invocation syntax ===

The program shall be invoked using the following syntax:

 monitor udp|tcp FORWARD_IP FORWARD_PORT LISTEN_PORT DELAY JITTER

where
 - udp|tcp : pick one of both to make the monitor work in this transport
   protocol

 - FORWARD_IP and FORWARD_PORT : ip address and port of your actual actual
   server where data is to be forwarded

 - LISTEN_PORT : the port where the monitor will listen.  The monitor will
   accept conenctions comming from any interface of the machine where it runs

 - DELAY and JITTER : they tell how the monitor will delay your packages, which
   depends on the transport protocol (TCP or UDP).  Both DELAY and JITTER shall
   be positive integers expressed in miliseconds.  

   The monitor first computes a value d defined as:

   d := max (0, DELAY + (JITTER * x))
 
   where x is taken uniformely at random in the real interval [-1, 1].
   Note that d >= 0 always.
 
   For a TCP connection, a data chunk that arrives from one given connection at
   time t will be forwarded at time
   
   max (t + d, t' + 1ms)

   where t' is the sending time of the last package received from the
   connection.  This ensures that chunks of data within the *same* TCP
   connection are forwarded in the same order they were received, with at least
   1ms delay.  Data chunks within different TCP connections are not warranted
   to be forwarded in the same order in which they were received.
 
   For UDP streams, a package that arrives at time t will be forwarded
   at time
   
   t + d.
 
   This could forward packages in an order different than that in which they
   were received.
